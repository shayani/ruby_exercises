# It is prefix-sum @ZeeshanShabbir, B is the upper bound, and A is the lower bound. first, you count all the divisor available from 1 to upper bound by B/K then you count all the divisor available from 1 to lower bound by A/K Then you use B/K - A/K, you will get all the divisor from A to B But wait, what if A divisible by K, then you will count it 2 times (from A and from B) then you need to check it to make sure it is only counted once. â€“
